# **JavaScript-Password-Generator**

## Project Description & Goals
   The project goals for this assignment were to develop a functional Javascript Password Generator, based off of starter code that was provided to us.  Using JavaScript alone, our goals were to have the user generate a randomized password based off of specific criteria.  This included a password character length of   8-128 characters.  
   
   Additionally, the user should have the capability to have the option of selecting from upper case letters, lower case letters, numeric values and special characters (via pop up confirm/prompt windows). 

   The overall goal of this project was to have a functional password generator that provides the strongest password possible for the security of the user.


## Action Items 

    1  Initially, all variables and arrays had to be written and determined for proper functionality.

    2  Next, a generate password function had to be created in order to house all the components to fuel the password generator. 

    3  An initial prompt was created, asking the users how many characters they want to be displayed.  This was followed by a seperate (if) conditional to not let the user continue if the value is not between 8-128 characters. 

    4  Next, an (else) conditional was put into place, to confirm with the user which particular set of array they wanted included in their password (lowercase, uppercase, numberical values and special characters) 

    5 Following this step, 4 seperate (if) conditionals were created to pull from each of the variable options listed for the user to pick from for their password.

    6 Finally, a function was created at the close of the JS to pull the password options back into the actual generator to be displayed for the user.
